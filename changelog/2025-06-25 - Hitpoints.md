# HP Rework!

Hitpoints have gotten an overhaul!
Here is a list of things that changed:

- Maximum hitpoints automatically include the constitution-modifier and will change accordingly
- Nonlethal damage is not possible (I've startet using 'Ablative Barrier', so this was a much needed change...)

Existing characters are upgraded when loading them for the first time. If you notice some error please inform me!
